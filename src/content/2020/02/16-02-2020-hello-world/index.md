This is my first attempt at a blog. I'm not a journalist and I don't want to be, I just wanted a safe corner where I could publish some opinions and some programming related stuff.

I'm also quite young and I'm relatively new of programming, so you will see a lot of _What x is used for?_ articles about a technology that I learned two days before.

I want to focus this blog on few things:
* functional programming using mainly [typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
* web design
* UX/UI
* _maybe_ books (I love read as you can see [here](https://christianpredebon.it/))

I don't know how it will end but I hope to be able to bring good content and interesting topic.

If you think it might interest you, feel free to [subscribe](https://christianpredebon.it/) or just check back in a while.
